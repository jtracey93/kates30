# Present

So what do you get the woman that...

1. Doesn't want anything
   - Because she has everything (a.k.a. me)
2. Doesn't have an expensive hobby, or several (just like your husband)
3. Doesn't like surprises
4. Doesn't like exhilarating experiences
   - Evidence: she cried for 12 hours prior to getting into a helicopter over a glacier in Alaska

5. Would only probably accept another dog as a present; if she's honest

## So...

How about another holiday or two? You get to choose:

- One long, fancy, expensive holiday?

**Or**
- Two shorter, long-weekend, city, road-trip style breaks?

### Possible Options...

#### Longer, fancy, expensive

- Maldives (as it's your default answer)
- Canada (again ...?)
- Iceland
- Somewhere else...?

#### Shorter, long-weekend, city, road-trip

Mix and match some of the below?

##### City Breaks/Long-Weekends

- Denmark (Copenhagen)
- Germany (Berlin)
- France (Paris)
- Sweden (Oslo)
- Norway
- Portugal (Lisbon)
- Ireland (Dublin)
- Somewhere else...?

##### Road Trip

- Scotland (again ...?)
  - Orkney etc.
- Ireland
- Wales
- Even another European country?

Could hire a camper van etc.?
