# Happy Birthday ü•≥

Well, well, well, welcome to the big **3 0**

*(Honestly, it's not that bad and nothing changes . And you already know a chiropractor üòÅ)*

Happy 30th birthday to my amazing wife, my teammate, my best friend; my day one!

You are the love of my life, the star of my sky, and the reason for my smile.

You do so much for us and I don't often get the chance to say I appreciate you more than you know.

I can't wait to celebrate with you and make this day, and weekend, special for you; you deserve it!

You're the most wonderful, the most beautiful, the most incredible person in the world, and I'm so lucky to have you by my side through the good and the bad.

*"Im nothing by myself"*

I love you more, always x

Jack
